Suppose you're creating a program to manage a school's enrollment system.
Your program should have a `Student` class, which has the following attributes:

name: a string representing the student's name
id: an integer representing the student's ID number
courses: an array of strings representing the courses the student is enrolled in
Your Student class should have the following methods:

A constructor that takes in the student's name and ID number and initializes the name and id attributes.
Getter and setter methods for the name, id, and courses attributes.
A method called addCourse that takes in a string representing a course and adds it to the courses array.
A method called printInfo that prints out the student's name, ID number, and enrolled courses.

Additionally, you should create a `GraduateStudent` class that inherits from the Student class. The GraduateStudent class should have an additional attribute:

researchArea: a string representing the graduate student's research area
The GraduateStudent class should have the following methods:

A constructor that takes in the graduate student's name, ID number, and research area, and initializes the name, id, and researchArea attributes.
Getter and setter methods for the researchArea attribute.
Override the printInfo method from the Student class to also print out the graduate student's research area.

Writeup - Boot2Root(VulnSphere) :




                                                          BOOT2ROOT CHALLENGE:
                                                                    
                                                                    
For understanding the challenge, I firstly tried to understand the basics of challenge i.e., regarding Vulnsphere and Boot2root and understood that Boot2root is a challenge that is made basically for CTFs. It contains in-built vulnerabilities and the objective is to solve the vulnerabilities and find the flag by connecting to ports that’s open in the given IP. Basically, to get the access to the machine.
For finding the vulnerabilities there are many ways such as: Port scanning, Netstat, Vulnerability scanning etc.
For finding the open ports I first used Nmap command to scan the open ports but it showing an error (the host seems down, if it is really up, but blocking our ping probes) so I tried Nmap with -sS and I got the ports that are open in the particular IP.
•	Then I tried to connect the FTP server with the port 2121 and entered the server using anonymous login and it got connected. Then extracted the file named “fear.txt” from the directory the found the flag in the file.
•	For http server, I browsed the IP with port 8000 and found the site of the next challenge. I was stuck and not understanding what to do with that website. Then finally learned the basic tools of website i.e., source code and inspect and then I tried to get some hints by reading the source code especially the comments in the source.
Then for http server I scanned the port using dirb command for hidden files. And found a file named fl4g.html. Copied the fl4g.html into another file and extracted the contents in the file using nano command. Thus, found the flag.
•	Then I connected the SSH server with the port number 2222, but it didn’t connect it was showing an error like permission denied (public key). Then I tried to connect it specifying the port number and it asked for password. For getting the password and username I used Wireshark. From tracking the IP I got the username and password. And then I connected to it and found many files inside the directory. I extracted a file named “read.txt” and found the flag inside the file.
